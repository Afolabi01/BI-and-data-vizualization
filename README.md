This is a repository that  represents projects I have done using Business intelligence tools such as Power BI(as this is my strong suite)  and so on
This repo would contain project done during internship and also when I was learning and preparing for my PL-300 examination.
At a point , I would start including resources that helped me in the mastery of Power BI.
